# iOS-Easier-Task
Using the latest version of Xcode, create an app that has one button and a text field with the number 0. When the button is pressed, increment the number by one.

# Your comments or assumptions
- <add them here>

I decided to add a reset button below to reset the number to zero again.

I added a few emojis to make it more enticing to press the button.
